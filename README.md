# Voice assisted Navigation app-
This project aims to develop a voice-controlled object detection system designed to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their environment safely and independently. The system uses a webcam and the YOLOv8 object detection model to recognize surrounding objects in real-time. It provides audio feedback about the detected objects, including their approximate distance, allowing users to understand their surroundings better without relying on sight.
